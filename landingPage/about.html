            <P>The saxophone (often referred to colloquially as the sax) is a type of single-reed 
               woodwind instrument with a conical body, usually made of brass. As with all 
               single-reed instruments, sound is produced when a reed on a mouthpiece vibrates 
               to produce a sound wave inside the instrument's body. 
               The pitch is controlled by opening and closing holes in the body to change the 
               effective length of the tube.[1] The 
               holes are closed by leather pads attached to keys operated by the player. 
               Saxophones are made in various sizes and are almost always treated as transposing 
               instruments. Saxophone players are called saxophonists.[2]
               The saxophone is used in a wide range of musical styles including classical music 
               (such as concert bands, chamber music, solo repertoire, and occasionally orchestras),
               military bands, marching bands, jazz (such as big bands and jazz combos), and 
               contemporary music. The saxophone is also used as a solo and melody instrument or as 
               a member of a horn section in some styles of rock and roll and popular music.</P>
               <P>
               The saxophone was invented by the Belgian instrument maker Adolphe Sax in the early 
               1840s[3] and was patented on 28 June 1846. Sax invented two groups of seven instruments 
               each—one group contained instruments in C and F, and the other group contained instruments 
               in B♭ and E♭. The B♭ and E♭ instruments soon became dominant, and most saxophones encountered 
               today are from this series. Instruments from the series pitched in C and F never gained a 
               foothold and constituted only a small fraction of instruments made by Sax. High-pitch 
               (also marked "H" or "HP") saxophones tuned sharper than the (concert) A = 440 Hz standard 
               were produced into the early twentieth century for sonic qualities suited for outdoor use, </P>
